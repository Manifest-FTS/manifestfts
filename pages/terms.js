                      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Manifest FTS offers scalable, managed WordPress hosting plans designed to support your business goals. Plans include performance-optimized infrastructure, backups, SSL, and quarterly maintenance. You retain ownership of your content, while infrastructure and platform-level configurations remain licensed and managed by Manifest.</p>
                      <p><strong>Clients enrolled in any WordPress Hosting Plan agree to the following terms:</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Hosting Plans:</strong> Each plan includes specific features and limitations. Starter includes 1 WordPress install, 25,000 monthly visits, 10GB storage, and 50GB bandwidth. Growth and Enterprise plans increase limits and add features such as performance insights, quarterly security reviews, and DevOps support. Full plan details are listed on our hosting page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Plan Scope:</strong> All plans include quarterly WordPress maintenance. Additional support, development work, or performance tuning may be billed separately unless covered under a promotional offer or retainer agreement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Access & Control:</strong> Clients have access to the WordPress admin dashboard, but do not receive root, cPanel, or database credentials. Platform infrastructure is fully managed and optimized by Manifest to ensure security and stability.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Backups & Uptime:</strong> We provide daily backups and make reasonable efforts to ensure uptime and security. However, we do not guarantee 100% uptime and are not liable for third-party outages, plugin failures, or customer-introduced errors.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Migration:</strong> If migrating from another host, Manifest will assist with one-time migration of WordPress files and database. The client is responsible for DNS access and third-party service coordination (e.g., email, CDN).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Our team monitors site performance and may recommend or apply server-side caching, image optimization, and code cleanup as part of Growth or Enterprise plans.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Custom Work:</strong> Custom features, API integrations, or non-standard plugins may be reviewed for compatibility, but are not guaranteed. Enterprise clients may receive priority support and tailored solutions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Promotional Entry:</strong> Active Growth or Enterprise plan subscribers who sign up or migrate after November 11, 2024 are automatically entered to win 10 free development hours ($1200 value). Winners are announced quarterly on the &ldquo;Ahead with FTS&rdquo; blog. Previous winners within the same calendar year are not eligible for repeat entry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Billing:</strong> Subscription fees are billed monthly. Failed payments may result in suspension after 15 days. Canceling the plan stops future billing but does not issue a refund for the current period.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Termination:</strong> Manifest FTS reserves the right to suspend or terminate hosting services for violations of these terms, non-payment, misuse of server resources, or abusive behavior.
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <h6 className="mt-35 mb-25" id="section-13">Free Website Promotion Terms</h6>
                      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Free Website Promotion waives the upfront setup fee in exchange for an active monthly support subscription. You retain ownership of your submitted content (text, images, logo), but the website design, source code, and backend remain licensed by Manifest FTS. Full admin access is restricted. Late payments may result in site suspension.</p>
                      <p><strong>Clients enrolled in this promotion agree to the following terms:</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Websites are built using pre-designed templates provided by ManifestFTS, and include up to five standard pages. Clients must choose from the available templates; design changes are not permitted except for minor visual adjustments (such as logo, colors, or small layout tweaks).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Access</strong> to the codebase, FTP or hosting control panel is not provided. However, limited WordPress admin access may be granted solely for posting and managing blog content.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Website delivery</strong> is included with your subscription. Upon signup, your website will be setup and launched within 45-60 business days, depending on prompt content submission and feedback. There are no setup or design fees — this service is included as part of your active subscription.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          This promotion does not include advanced development, third-party integrations, or non-scope custom requests unless agreed upon separately in an Advanced plan.
                        </li>
                        <li>Refunds will not be issued for setup, partial months, or ongoing subscriptions once the website has been published. Canceling the subscription stops future billing but does not entitle the customer to any refund.</li>
                        <li>Manifest FTS reserves the right to suspend or terminate service for violations of these terms, misuse of the platform, abusive behavior, or failure to pay.</li>
